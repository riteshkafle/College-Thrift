Inspiration

Though we have a Facebook marketplace and various other platforms to buy second-hand goods we all know the level of scam that happens in these current existing marketplaces. Every college student needs a variety of things for their college transition; buying everything firsthand is expensive. Going to these pre-existing marketplaces and meeting new people to carry a deal could be a hassle for a college student and he/she could also potentially led to be scammed. In addition to that college students may also lose different items inside the campus. So, College Thrift is developed to solve these two issues.

What it does

So, this is basically a platform where verified college students can buy or sell things by getting them registered with us using their college emails which prevents the chances of being scammed on our app. A freshman mostly has to face problems regarding buying things during college time. As it is hard for students to buy new books and new furniture like tables and chairs, So, here comes our app as a lifesaver. Students can easily create a post to sell their old stuff like books, furniture, and sometimes even gadgets, at a reasonable price. And buyers and sellers can communicate with one another via college e-mail or phone number and strike a great deal on their own. Also, there is a section for lost and found items where anyone can post about the found product, and the system for lost and found items gets organized and managed in real time so that the students can search for their lost items and eventually find them.
